# Chess-Game-SFML

Hello! This game is coded intirely on C++ with the help of the SFML(Super Fast Media Library) library. 
If you are wanting to understand the code you should read a little about SFML and get to know the basic things one is capable of doing with this library.
Best way to do this is rading the tutorials from their site https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/ they are very simple and well explained. Other way is watching videos
but my opinion is that reading from the site will be faster.

Ways to play:
 - Meet with a friend and take turns.
 - Alone, trying or experimenting moves.

Steps to run the code:
 - Download & Install SFML(Super Fast Media Library) from https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php
 - Link the Installed library to Visual Studio following the steps in the video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfMQyOw1zik
 - Create folder named "Textures" in the Project directory.
 - Download the png's of the figures from the repository. Put them in the folder which we created in the previous step and make sure not to change the names of the png's or the code won't work.
 - Run code.

How to change the textures of the Figures:
 - Delete the png's from the "Textures" folder.
 - Put the new png's on their place in the "Textures" folder. (Important!: Set the same names to the new png's or the code won't compile.)
 - Run code.

Notes:
 - There is no possibility to play against AI.
 - There is no multiplayer connectivity.
